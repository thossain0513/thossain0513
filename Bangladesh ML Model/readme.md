In this project, I wanted to build a model that would forecast some of the economic indicators that play a large role in the functionality of Bangladesh. Aside from
the fact that I myself am from there, Bangladesh was a perfect country to analyze in the sense that it is a developing country whose own industrialization and growth
is taking place at an unprecedented rate. In contrast to many countries in the West, economic indicators in Bangladesh would tend to fluctuate a lot more because
it's such a young country and it's economy is not yet solidified or large enough to have easy forecasts.
