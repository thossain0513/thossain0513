- Hi, Iâ€™m Toufiq Hossain, a data science and economics major at UC Berkeley. Being a first-generation Bangladeshi-American attending college at the University of California, Berkeley, a lot of my interests lie in the region of modeling with regards to banking and economic data, where I tend to place my focus on. Here, I showcase my work on various datasets obtained from kaggle.com and hope to solve various problems in the world through the means of data.
